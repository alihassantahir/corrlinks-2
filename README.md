# Corrlinks Chrome Extension 2 (Sender)

Using the extension

## Starting:

The extension should only be started when you have logged into Corrlinks. It will then redirect you to the Compose message page to start its working.

If you try to start it on any other website/login page/or special pages, it will display an alert and not proceed further.

To start it, click its Icon in the browser Extensions button. 

The icon will indicate the extension's status.


NOTE: Please avoid running both extensions in the same tab, i.e. If the Receiver extension is already activated on say Tab 2, please make sure to activate the Sender extension on any other tab. Because they'll interfere and none can do it's job.

## Stopping Extension:

To stop an extension, click the same button again or close the tab (Reloading the tab will not stop the Extension)

## Automatic Termination:
When the user logs out after activating the extension, it will automatically HALT itself ASAP.
